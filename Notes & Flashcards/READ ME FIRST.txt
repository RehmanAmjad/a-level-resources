=== Important Points ===

- These notes / flashcards WILL contain mistakes.

- By using these notes / flashcards, I cannot accept any blame for 
  questions you get wrong because of these notes / flashcards.

- They were never made with the intention of sharing them so some
  things may be written in a way that only makes sense to me. Please
  feel free to edit them to fit your needs.

- The .docx and .pdf files closely match the flashcards. In the cases
  they don't, the flashcard is the most accurate and latest version.

- You should do lots of exam practice to test yourself. Just reading
  notes and going over flashcards will take you so far.
  
- There are also a few notes for maths and further maths that I used
  made during my classes which may be useful to some.
