# A Level Resources
This is a collection of all the flashcards and files I created during my A-levels. They have been mostly untouched since my A-levels. I have made them open to share after receiving many requests.

## Table of Contents

- [Roadmap](#roadmap)

## Downloading the Files
You can find the download page under [releases](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/a-level-resources/releases) on the right hand side of the page. Make sure you download the latest release by pressing the first  `Source code` button on the page. You can then extract the folder and files and get studying!

Be sure to bookmark the releases page and check it regularly for updates (or make a GitHub account and watch this repository by pressing the `Watch` button on the top right).

## Reporting Issues
If you find any mistakes in any notes or flashcards then either make a GitHub account and create and issue under the issues tab of this repository or email me at ` ra570 (at) cam.ac.uk`.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1 - make Anki only
_To avoid having to manage two versions of the same flashcard, one in word document form and another in Anki form (which have fallen out of sync slightly), we need to delete the word document form but keep the PDF's._

1. Wait for [PDF Glossary Exporter](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1334168683) to come out for Anki 2.1.
2. Tag all cards corresponding to the specification.
3. Move cards into seperate decks according to the specification.
4. Export each module in the specification as a seperate PDF.
5. Delete all the Word documents.

### Phase 2 - continual improvements
Look through a few flashcards on Anki every weekend and make small improvements.
